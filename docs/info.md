## How it works

This project implements the classic _Simon Says_ game. The design uses digital logic to control game flow and memory elements to store a pseudo-random sequence of colors. The system interfaces with external buttons and LEDs to allow human interaction and gameplay.

### Game Flow

Upon powering up the chip:

1. **Idle State**

   - Waits for the `start` signal.
   - A 8-bit seed is loaded into the LFSR via the bidirectional bus.
   - A 32-bit pseudo-random sequence is generated by the LFSR.
   - Each color is encoded in 2 bits, allowing up to 16 rounds (16 × 2 bits = 32 bits).
   - The sequence is stored in a 32-bit register-based memory.

2. **Display State**

   - Displays the current round's color sequence on the LEDs.

3. **Wait State**

   - Waits for user inputs through button presses and stores the respective colour sequence.

4. **Check State**

   - Verifies the user inputs against the stored color sequence.
   - If correct, advances to the next round, increments sequence length count, and loops back to the Display State.
   - If incorrect, the game ends and returns to Idle state and waits for `start` signal.
   - Note: Based on the design even if the user enters an incorrect colour early on, the user must enter enough colours for that sequence before the mistake is detected. For example, if the user is on the 5th round with a 5 colour sequence, if the second colour entry is incorrect, the user will still need to enter the 3rd, 4th, and 5th colour.

5. **End of Game**
   - Triggered when either the player completes 16 rounds or enters an incorrect sequence.
   - Returns to waiting for the `start` signal to begin a new game.

### Key Components

1.  **32-bit Register Memory**

- Stores the color sequence (16 values × 2 bits).

2. **8-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)**

   - Generates a pseudo-random 32-bit sequence.
   - Uses a 8th-order primitive polynomial to ensure maximal length (2^8 - 1 = 255 values).
   - Special logic ensures the state never becomes all zeros.
   - Seeded externally to vary game sequences across resets and sessions.

3. **Color Encoder/Decoder**

   - Converts 4 individual button signals into a single 2-bit color value for logic comparison (and vice versa).
   - Ensures consistent color encoding across modules.

4. **Game States**
   - Contains the logic to execute each state of the game.
5. **State Debug**

   - Current game state -- represented as a 2 bit value -- is assert on 2 output ports as a means to debug.

### Timing Diagram

Below shows the expected timing diagram for one loop of the game. It transitions between the IDLE, DISPLAY, WAIT, and CHECK states and then resets for next loop.

Note, much of the timing relies on user input so the displayed state durations may not match the lengths during gameplay. A random LFSR Seed of 0x5B is loaded along with a current display sequence of 1, 4, 1, 8 or (0b0001, 0b0100, 0b0001, 0b1000).

## How to test

### Gameplay Functionality

- Simulate a full 16-round win by entering the correct sequence each round. Game should return to `IDLE` after round 16.
- Simulate a mistake during a round (e.g., round 5). Game should detect incorrect input in `CHECK` and return to `IDLE`.

### Game State Transitions

- Verify transitions using state debug signal:
  - `IDLE → DISPLAY → WAIT → CHECK → DISPLAY` (if correct), or `IDLE` (if incorrect)
- Confirm each state's role:
  - `DISPLAY`: Colour is displayed long enough for user to understand and colour sequence is consistent between rounds.
  - `WAIT`: State ends only when all required colours are entered. (ex. if on the 5th round, must wait until 5 colours are entered).
  - `CHECK`: Correct validation. (if the user enters a correct sequence, it should continue the game, if not should end the game).

### Startup & Seeding

- On power-up, game should remain in `IDLE` until Start is pressed. Verify using State debug signal.
- Provide an 8-bit seed and press Start — game should transition to `DISPLAY`. Verify using State debug signal.
- Using the same seed should yield the same sequence. Different seeds should generate different sequences (LFSR test).

### Reset Behavior

- Press reset in any state — game should return to `IDLE`, discarding current game state.
  - Test reset: before `IDLE`, during `IDLE`, `DISPLAY`, `WAIT`, `CHECK`
